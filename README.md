# node-email-campaigner - Email Campaign Manager for Node.js

Supercharge your email campaigns with node-email-campaigner to schedule and send robust emails on time and with proper formatting and templating.

## Why did I build this ?

I'm currently working on my own [Startup - skillShack(âš¡);](https://skillshack.dev) which a social network for users to share the projects/products they are building. And I found myself needing a way to send emails to my users, and so I decided to build this and OpenSource it!

## Features

- [ ] Simply point to your templates folder (folder with html and txt files for each email). And supply your initial email list as an array to the API.
- [ ] You can schedule emails to be sent at a specific time. Uses CRON.
- [ ] Create specific campaigns targetting specific users at once.

## Installation

Install node-email-campaigner using yarn:

```bash
yarn add node-email-campaigner
```

Or npm:

```bash
npm install --save node-email-campaigner
